### Neural Modeling Methods and Tools

**Overview:** This course offers a practical journey from foundational machine learning concepts to advanced deep learning techniques. It's segmented into two focused parts:

1. **Foundational Machine Learning:** Starting with the basics, students explore key concepts like Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines (SVM), laying a solid foundation for more complex topics.
2. **Advanced Neural Networks:** Progressing to sophisticated architectures, the course covers Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), RNN with Attention Mechanisms, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Transformers.

**Goal:** Building basic machine learning models to deploying complex neural network architectures, ensuring a deep understanding of both theory and practical implementation.
